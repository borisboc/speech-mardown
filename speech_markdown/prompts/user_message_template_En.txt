Act as a simple word processing program.
Here are my requests: you will correct the text below while trying to stay as close as possible to it.
You must obviously keep the original language of the text: English.
You will add punctuation (commas and periods) and capital letters (for the beginning of new sentences).
You will correct spelling and conjugation errors.
You will correct vocabulary errors that are obvious and undeniable.
In case of doubt, you will leave the original word in the text.

You will not delete content, even if it seems useless.
Return only the corrected text.
The final result will be in markdown form.
Here is the text to modify:
